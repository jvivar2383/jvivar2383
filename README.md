- 👋Hi, I’m Jenifer Vivar
- Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Paul Torres.

I used to work in Physics with a focus on atmospheric physics research before I turned to focus full time on Data Science. I am interested in telling stories using data. I spend my time learning new topics about machine learning and writing articles on Medium about the techniques that I learn.

I've written articles on everything from past projects, to algorithm review for further learning, to deep learning concepts like pseudo-supervised learning and I look to continue to learn by doing and passing on that knowledge to the wider community.

As a former research scientist, I've found that exploratory analysis and using the data to build a narrative are the most exciting aspects of data science.

Projects I am currently working on include:

Tanzanian Water Pump Hackathon
Automated text extractor for transferring information from a detailed report to tabular sheet format
Topic Modeling and Basic NLP Analysis of the Harry Potter Series
You can also find me at:
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and climate change
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and machine learning as well as kickboxing :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis with climate data, particularly on Mixing Layer Height and Boundary Layer Height.
