Hi there!
My name is Jenifer Vivar.

I hold a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics, and I recently earned my Master's degree in data science. I am interested in telling stories using data. I spend my time learning new topics about machine learning and applying my knowledge to different projects that will soon be posted on my page.

As a former research scientist, I've found that exploratory analysis and using the data to build a narrative are the most exciting aspects of data science.

Projects I am currently working on include:

- Mixing Layer Height and its Effects on Pollutants during NYC's Heat Wave event.
- Algorithm Optimization to Accurately measure Mixing Layer Height Levels using Doppler Lidar Technology.
